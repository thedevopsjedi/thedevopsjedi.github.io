      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post I’ve wanted to write for a while, but was one of those side projects I’ve picked up and put down a few times due to other priorities getting in the way.  This idea came about because I wrote a PowerShell script to perform some housekeeping actions in Azure and I wanted it to run unattended on a scheduled basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
