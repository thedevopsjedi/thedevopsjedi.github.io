      <title>From Years to Days: Preparing For The Future of TLS Certificates</title>
      <link>https://www.thedevopsjedi.co.uk/certificates/certificate-lifetimes/tls-certificate-lifetimes-reduced-to-47-days/</link>

      <guid>https://www.thedevopsjedi.co.uk/certificates/certificate-lifetimes/tls-certificate-lifetimes-reduced-to-47-days/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public TLS certificates have been reducing in lifetime over the past decade. What was once a three, or even five year certificate is now valid for little over a year. The next major step will be far more dramatic: certificate lifetimes are set to reduce to &lt;strong&gt;just 47 days&lt;/strong&gt; by 2029, with the first reductions beginning in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For cloud, product, and security teams, this is not just an incremental policy change — it will fundamentally reshape how certificates are managed, deployed, and renewed across internal and external services. Manual processes will no longer be sustainable, and automation will become a compliance necessity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deleting An Azure Resource That Is Stuck In A &#39;Deleting Resource&#39; Status</title>
      <link>https://www.thedevopsjedi.co.uk/azure/deleting-a-stuck-resource/</link>

      <description>I have recently been working with some of Azure&amp;rsquo;s Artifical Intelligence (AI) resources, and had built out a lab in Terraform only to find when destroying it the resource was stuck in a &amp;lsquo;Deleting Resource&amp;rsquo; state.  I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to remove it via the portal or via Terraform &amp;amp; couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a solution online either. So this post is to capture what I did in the hope it helps someone in the future.</description>

      <title>Creating A Modern Azure Diagnostics Policy That Generative AI Couldn&#39;t - Yet!</title>

      <description>I have recently been working with an organisation who wanted to improve their security posture in Azure by using Azure Policy to configure Diagnostic Settings for their Azure resources at scale.  They wanted to make use of Category Groups to dynamically collect all available logs and metrics and simplify the policy logic so it could be reused across multiple resources.  I thought &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;that sounds simple enough as there will be a built in policy that does all that&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t, so I set to work.</description>

Creating custom policies should always be a last resort, as the BuiltIn policies Azure provides are kept up to date and version controlled by Microsoft.  As soon as you create a custom policy, you are responsible for maintaining it when capability is added or deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, I soon realised there was no way in the Azure Portal or the native Azure RM Terraform provider to export the Activity Logs to a Log Analytics Workspace for use with Sentinel, so I decided to figure out a solution to this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post I’ve wanted to write for a while, but was one of those side projects I’ve picked up and put down a few times due to other priorities getting in the way.  This idea came about because I wrote a PowerShell script to perform some housekeeping actions in Azure and I wanted it to run unattended on a scheduled basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have already touched on the importance of Terraform state in a previous post, but I wanted to expand on this from a security perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get this out the way now, Terraform stores secrets in its state file in plain text!  There I said it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So how do I protect against secrets being revealed that could allow an attacker to compromise my systems?  Well, I use a defence in depth strategy in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Minimise Terraform Admin Effort &amp; Manage The Constant Change</title>
      <link>https://www.thedevopsjedi.co.uk/terraform/lessons-learnt/minimise-admin-effort/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a previous post I explained why I don&amp;rsquo;t advocate the use of child modules, but I wanted to quickly explain how I keep Terraform admin overhead to a minimum when creating standard resources whilst also working with the constant rate of change that cloud brings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Use Of Terraform Child Modules</title>
      <link>https://www.thedevopsjedi.co.uk/terraform/lessons-learnt/use-of-child-modules/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.thedevopsjedi.co.uk/terraform/lessons-learnt/use-of-child-modules/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Terraform uses the construct of a module, which is &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/modules/module#:~:text=A%20Terraform%20module%20is%20a%20set%20of%20Terraform%20configuration%20files%20in%20a%20single%20directory&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;defined by HashiCorp&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; as &amp;ldquo;a set of Terraform configuration files in a single directory&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;root module&lt;/code&gt; consists of resources defined in the main working directory (which I like to refer to as the &amp;rsquo;execution folder&amp;rsquo;).  However, you can also call other modules to include their configuration.  These are known as &lt;code&gt;child modules&lt;/code&gt; which can be shared and reused by multiple root module configurations.  Sounds good, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>When writing a Terraform configuration, you want to keep all elements readable so whoever needs to interpret it in the future can easily understand the outcome the configuration deploys.  This is how I do it.</description>

      <title>How To Generate JSON With Terraform Without Using Heredoc Strings</title>
      <link>https://www.thedevopsjedi.co.uk/terraform/lessons-learnt/generating-json-or-yaml/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.thedevopsjedi.co.uk/terraform/lessons-learnt/generating-json-or-yaml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently discovered but thought it was worth sharing here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a few configurations where I need to pass JSON to Terraform to process.  The most used resource where I do this is azurerm_virtual_machine_extension.  The example &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/virtual_machine_extension&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;HashiCorp documentation&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; still shows the use of Heredoc strings which is probably why I hadn&amp;rsquo;t picked up on it until now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered a &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/strings#generating-json-or-yaml&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;HashiCorp article&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; where they tell you that by using the jsonencode and yamlencode functions &amp;ldquo;Terraform can be responsible for guaranteeing valid JSON or YAML syntax&amp;rdquo;.  This sounded good to me as JSON syntax is not very forgiving, and it is designed to be read and processed by machines (not humans).  If you put a comma or a bracket in the wrong place, you will soon be in a whole world of pain.  The same is true for YAML and indentations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Structure Terraform Folders &amp; Apply Naming Standards</title>
      <link>https://www.thedevopsjedi.co.uk/terraform/lessons-learnt/structure-and-naming-standards/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.thedevopsjedi.co.uk/terraform/lessons-learnt/structure-and-naming-standards/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started using Terraform in 2018 the content online was mainly written from a developer&amp;rsquo;s perspective and was based on deploying resources into AWS.  This was a great starting point, but the key messages in the blogs I read were all fairly consistent and seemed to align to the excellent &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;blog series by Yevgeniy Brikman&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; from 2016 which is well worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I read the series, took all the key messages onboard and started deploying resources into Azure.  However, as our environment began to scale and more engineers came onboard, it was soon clear I needed to formalise our ways of working to ensure everyone followed a standard approach as we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be operating the &amp;lsquo;you build it you run it&amp;rsquo; model.  This meant that once cloud services were provisioned and live, they needed to be handed over to operations who would also need to understand the Terraform configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Darren Johnson and I have been working in IT for over 20 years.  I currently work as an Azure Platform Architect in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of my career has been spent focusing on designing and delivering core data centre technologies and infrastructure from as far back as the Windows NT 4.0 days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having spent a number of years working as a Cloud Infrastructure Architect, in 2021 I decided to pivot and move into the DevOps space.  I am not an application developer by trade, but I do have a strong background in automation which has meant I have been able to apply DevOps tools and techniques to deploy and secure cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
