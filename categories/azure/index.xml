      <description>I have recently been working with some of Azure&amp;rsquo;s Artifical Intelligence (AI) resources, and had built out a lab in Terraform only to find when destroying it the resource was stuck in a &amp;lsquo;Deleting Resource&amp;rsquo; state.  I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to remove it via the portal or via Terraform &amp;amp; couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a solution online either. So this post is to capture what I did in the hope it helps someone in the future.</description>
