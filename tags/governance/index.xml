      <title>From Years to Days: Preparing For The Future of TLS Certificates</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public TLS certificates have been reducing in lifetime over the past decade. What was once a three, or even five year certificate is now valid for little over a year. The next major step will be far more dramatic: certificate lifetimes are set to reduce to &lt;strong&gt;just 47 days&lt;/strong&gt; by 2029, with the first reductions beginning in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For cloud, product, and security teams, this is not just an incremental policy change â€” it will fundamentally reshape how certificates are managed, deployed, and renewed across internal and external services. Manual processes will no longer be sustainable, and automation will become a compliance necessity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating A Modern Azure Diagnostics Policy That Generative AI Couldn&#39;t - Yet!</title>

      <description>I have recently been working with an organisation who wanted to improve their security posture in Azure by using Azure Policy to configure Diagnostic Settings for their Azure resources at scale.  They wanted to make use of Category Groups to dynamically collect all available logs and metrics and simplify the policy logic so it could be reused across multiple resources.  I thought &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;that sounds simple enough as there will be a built in policy that does all that&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t, so I set to work.</description>

Creating custom policies should always be a last resort, as the BuiltIn policies Azure provides are kept up to date and version controlled by Microsoft.  As soon as you create a custom policy, you are responsible for maintaining it when capability is added or deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exporting Azure Management Group Activity Logs</title>

However, I soon realised there was no way in the Azure Portal or the native Azure RM Terraform provider to export the Activity Logs to a Log Analytics Workspace for use with Sentinel, so I decided to figure out a solution to this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
