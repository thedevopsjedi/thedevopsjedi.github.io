      <title>From Years to Days: Preparing For The Future of TLS Certificates</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public TLS certificates have been reducing in lifetime over the past decade. What was once a three, or even five year certificate is now valid for little over a year. The next major step will be far more dramatic: certificate lifetimes are set to reduce to &lt;strong&gt;just 47 days&lt;/strong&gt; by 2029, with the first reductions beginning in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For cloud, product, and security teams, this is not just an incremental policy change â€” it will fundamentally reshape how certificates are managed, deployed, and renewed across internal and external services. Manual processes will no longer be sustainable, and automation will become a compliance necessity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- Summary of Article (70 Words)  &#xA;&#xA;# Table Of Contents  &#xA;&#xA;&lt;nav id=&#34;TableOfContents&#34;&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;  &#xA; --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Management Groups a lot recently in my day job and have really seen the benefit of being able to enforce governance by assigning RBAC roles and policies once, and have all new subscriptions inherit them. However, I soon realised there was no way in the Azure Portal or the native Azure RM Terraform provider to export the Activity Logs to a Log Analytics Workspace for use with Sentinel, so I decided to figure out a solution to this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
