      <description>I have recently been working with some of Azure&amp;rsquo;s Artifical Intelligence (AI) resources, and had built out a lab in Terraform only to find when destroying it the resource was stuck in a &amp;lsquo;Deleting Resource&amp;rsquo; state.  I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to remove it via the portal or via Terraform &amp;amp; couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a solution online either. So this post is to capture what I did in the hope it helps someone in the future.</description>

      <description>I have recently been working with an organisation who wanted to improve their security posture in Azure by using Azure Policy to configure Diagnostic Settings for their Azure resources at scale.  They wanted to make use of Category Groups to dynamically collect all available logs and metrics and simplify the policy logic so it could be reused across multiple resources.  I thought &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;that sounds simple enough as there will be a built in policy that does all that&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t, so I set to work.</description>
