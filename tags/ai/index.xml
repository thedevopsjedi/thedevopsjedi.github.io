They wanted to make use of Category Groups to dynamically collect all available logs and metrics and simplify the policy logic so it could be reused across multiple resources.  I thought &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;that sounds simple enough as there will be a built in policy that does all that&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t, so I set to work.</description>
