      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public TLS certificates have been reducing in lifetime over the past decade. What was once a three, or even five year certificate is now valid for little over a year. The next major step will be far more dramatic: certificate lifetimes are set to reduce to &lt;strong&gt;just 47 days&lt;/strong&gt; by 2029, with the first reductions beginning in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For cloud, product, and security teams, this is not just an incremental policy change â€” it will fundamentally reshape how certificates are managed, deployed, and renewed across internal and external services. Manual processes will no longer be sustainable, and automation will become a compliance necessity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
